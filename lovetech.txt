Since I got my first computer which was a commodore 64, not only did i fall in love with computers but with the technology as well. After studying technology I started realizing how much easier it makes our lives in a lot ofareas. Say for instance a cell phone, used to be my car would break down on highway I had to walk to phone booth to get help now I just pull the old cell phone out LOL.
